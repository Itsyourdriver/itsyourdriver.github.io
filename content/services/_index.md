# Services

I selfhost a couple of "alternative frontends" and (soon) other services which are completely free to use.

- [LibreMDb](https://lmdb.driver.fyi) - A frontend for iMDb.
- [Quetre](https://quetre.driver.fyi) - A frontend for Quora.
- [AnonymousOverflow](https://quetre.driver.fyi) - A frontend for StackOverflow and all of their sites.

All are protected by [Anubis](https://anubis.techaro.lol/), and currently have some logging enabled.
Logs are not monitored or shared/sold, and will be disabled once I can finalize my setup.

## What are alternative frontends?
I'll put it in my own words, Alternative Frontends are an alternative way to view certain websites (iMDb, Quora, etc) with no tracking, popups, or ads. They proxy your request for you (preventing data such as your [public IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Get_my_IP_address), [User Agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent), and [data used to track you across the web and link said data to your identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint)), and present the information from the website to you in a cleaner format.

In all cases, unless it is something that you run as an application and not use as a website, alternative frontends do NOT support using your account with said service (iMDb, Quora, etc).

You can find frontends for [all sorts of websites/services](https://github.com/digitalblossom/alternative-frontends).

If you want to automatically redirect from different websites to a frontend, check out a browser extension such as [LibRedirect](https://libredirect.github.io/).

(if the above extension isn't compatible with your browser (ex: you are using chrome), you might want to consider switching to something such as [Firefox](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/) or [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/))
