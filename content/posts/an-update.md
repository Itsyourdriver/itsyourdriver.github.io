Hello howdy hola bonjour! It's been a good few months since I last posted here, and also since I last streamed or posted a video on my channel, and I feel like giving an update on my almost complete radio silence.

In this time, I've been working on getting a grasp on my mental health (this is a consistent battle on my end), all while fighting self-doubt and other things. I've been away from game development, not just because I needed a break, but because I was overwhelmed. I had put too many projects (3 TOTAL! NOT GOOD AT ALL) into something that I'd like to continue doing for the rest of my life, and as such, got overwhelmed quickly.

I almost feel that I'm ready to come back, and I will be back very soon this *Thursday at 8pm EDT* (usually would be wednesday but due to ongoing stuff with family I need to move it a day forward)

You can also notice that this site no longer spans the whole width of your browser (might be different on mobile), which was a choice by me as I didn't like the way it looked before. (which was changed originally because I didn't originally like the way this looked before, it's come full circle lol)

This should feel a little more comfortable, and I might be swapping the theme of this site to something custom or another public hugo theme in the future, but this is how it'll be for now.

# game dev talk (oh the horror)

good news ~~(we can finally be bees)~~ I intend to slowly but surely mix game development into my streaming schedule once I'm fully back to it, as it's one of my dreams which I do not want to give up on. It's the main thing keeping me going nowadays, although I'd probably still find a way to keep going either way.

This should be much easier to do as I've been scoping down my game development project slowly but surely, reshaping it into something that's do-able but not quite a "tiny game" as I don't enjoy those too much. Something I did find out that I wasn't too sure of before is that I sure as hell cannot do everything myself, and that was likely one of the bigger downfalls of my last attempt, but I don't intend on giving up. I plan on focusing primarily on a few key aspects that I feel make the biggest impact on players, and outsourcing for help when I feel that I might need it.

As of now I won't be swapping engines, although it may be required if I feel that the current topics or ideas in my game are restricted by ROBLOX's platform guidelines/terms, which keeps teetering on an "i'm not sure" basis, this is not helped by the fact that nobody knows who I am. If I am falsely banned at some point, I don't have anyone to help get the word out.

Some things are uncertain, others I have to take some time to read through the terms which I (despite being on the platform for years) haven't done myself. The main one is blood, as it seems to be inconsistently moderated. What is allowed and what isn't? If my game is set to the right age ratings/restrictions am I allowed to have blood or will it get taken down because I can't age restrict the asset as there's no way to specify?

If there's any engine/platform I'll be moving to, it's going to be either [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) or [UE5](https://www.unrealengine.com/). I was originally considering CryEngine but it doesn't seem that it would be worth it to learn after hearing about the way some of their assets work. I'm unsure if it's changed but it seemed like you needed a photoshop plugin to export compatible textures, specific software for 3d assets, etc. That's not something I want to deal with.

Some people might say "but but ue5 bad!! TAA!! unoptimized!!!!" to that I say that I believe that it is the fault of the developers using said engine. Excluding some of the features that I see have a lot of discussion regarding their performance (nanite, clouds???), I think that UE5 seems to have a lot of flexibility and features making development easier, it depends on how the actual developer uses said tool. If they decide to rely on something like nanite to optimize their game, and don't try and implement alternative options for things like Anti-Aliasing, then the performance and overall look isn't going to look good. if I end up going with it, I intend on avoiding the "unreal engine look" entirely, as I feel that a proper art style is more than possible to achieve while still staying within the realstic look that I want to go for. I have a few art-styles which I may attempt, but I can't say I'll ever do anything with them. (for example, the PS1 look)

Overall, I'm leaning towards unreal engine. But hey, who knows what I'll end going with.


# FINALLY, 

- I finally made the jump to [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/) after Chrome killed off Manifest V2, although I still have occasional issues which make me swap back for two specific things I self host.
- I'm now hosting an instance of [LibreMDb](https://codeberg.org/zyachel/libremdb), which you can find [here](https://lmdb.driver.fyi/find). Unfortunately it's behind cloudflare for now however I'm planning on migrating it and likely adding it to the public instance list of LibreMDb in the future. More frontends/public services soon :D (if you have any ideas/suggestions for these, please dm me :p)
- One of my [spotify playlists](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7y4XRBNSK1DpMyvaUnFBxe) has managed to hit 13,100 saves. I don't even know how.

# Some screenshots

I also want to leave you with a few fun things that I've found/screenshots from when I was gone from here: (there isn't much because I don't usually document what I do day-to-day as I felt it wasn't important, although I'm slowly working to change that)

Some screenshots from Death Stranding (Specifically Director's Cut):

this is alot more of a rant or vent or whatever you want to call it then anything actually readable, but if you read the entire thing I appreciate it.

until next time,
