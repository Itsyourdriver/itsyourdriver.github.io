Hello again, we're reaching the new year, and while I do not have much of any updates on my game development project for you as ROBLOX's recent changes regarding who can chat are still making me apprehensive on whether to stay, we will see the effect on playercounts once the update has fully released, even though my game does not use chat.


Anyway, here's everything:

# This site is now available over TOR.
## Edit: tor url down for forseeable future, it was mostly broken anyway.

I won't provide a link here, but you can find the hidden service URL embedded into each and every page, your TOR browser should pick the url up for you automatically.
It isn't always kept in sync because I need to setup a custom cronjob to automatically pull the git repo behind this website, but we're almost there haha.

# Frontend update

If you hadn't noticed due to me making no announcement on it to keep traffic low, I have been hosting a few privacy frontends for a few months, and plan to continue to until my VPS provider shuts me down or I move providers or I no longer want to host them.

I have had to discontinue hosting Redlib due to issues with the fork I was using AND issues with the IP Addresses that I can route through on the regular version of Redlib. Any data (subreddit subscriptions, settings, etc) can be recovered by going to your browser's cookies I believe, as I cannot get the instance up and running for a proper export. I apologize.

I plan to host a few other frontends that don't have as many public instances available within the next few weeks, but if I do not get around to it you can assume that I am busy and just keeping things up and running for the few that are left running.

Finally, all of my frontends will eventually be accessible over TOR, just not at the moment.

# Youtube & Other Platforms Status

Consider me on break and potentially permanently on vacation from uploading or posting on any platforms.

I have no interest in coming back to streaming or working on more youtube videos for the time being.

**P.S I deleted my soundcloud account recently so if the URL to it is left anywhere please let me know, if the link happens to suddenly have a profile on it, you should know that it is NOT me.**

# Cloudflare

I am beginning to migrate this website off of cloudflare, I have a few other things to do still, but we already are not using their CDN/DDOS protection and just basically the DNS services for this site.

Primarily moving to make sure that if they go down I will not be affected, but also because Cloudflare allegedly oversees upwards of 20%+ of of the internet. I'd love for this site to be fully selfhosted sometime but until then we will be on github pages.

See you all on the other side,
