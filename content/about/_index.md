Howdy! I'm Itsyourdriver, an indie game developer from the United States. I also happen to make videos on a site you might have heard of already. (yes, YouTube)

I also am quite into all things related to self-hosting, linux (I'm still daily driving windows, I know I know) & more. This site has been a long time coming, as I never really had a place to post blogs/random stuff easily... until now!

You'll see me post on topics such as reviews of software, game reviews (maybe), a journal of my game development journey, tutorials, + more. Everything will be sorted by tags, and rss feeds are available.

This website replaces my old personal site which was made with Google Sites (not great, but it got the job done for a while). I'm much happier with this now, however I will likely change the theme here and there.
