Howdy! I'm Itsyourdriver, an indie game developer from the United States. I also happen to make videos on a site you might have heard of already. (yes, YouTube)

I also am quite into all things related to self-hosting, linux (I'm still daily driving windows, I know I know), nature, books & movies. This site has been a long time coming, as I never really had a place to post blogs/random stuff easily... until now!

You'll see me post on topics such as reviews of software, game reviews (maybe), a journal of my game development journey, tutorials, + more. Everything will be sorted by tags, and rss feeds are available. This site also supports screenreaders, and 

This website replaces my old personal site which was made with Google Sites (not great, but it got the job done for a while). I'm much happier with this now, however I will likely change the theme here and there.

I do not ever want my website to have any of the following:
- Trackers (includes things as simple as website view counters or analytics)
- Ads
- Comments (can be nice, but a pain to moderate, might change my opinion on this in the future)
- Popups/Banners
- Cookies
- Bloat (site should be quick to load over something like the TOR network or over a slow connection)
- Embeds which may violate your privacy in some way (youtube video embeds/social media embeds/disqus)
