Info regarding contact:

To avoid spam / scraping by bots, if you need my contact email, drop by my youtube channel or Artstation to find it. If you don't like email, drop into my discord or my matrix DMs, although I am less likely to respond on twitter as I rarely check it.

[Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/itsyourdriver) (i am not a fan of epic's new FAB marketplace. it is honestly so much worse than sketchfab and the unreal marketplace, not to mention it caused all sorts of stuff because they weren't clear about quixel and fab.)
