  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>This is going to be a short post from me, I just wanted to post about this because it was quite annoying.
As some of you may know, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXoUsdSAnA">NVIDIA happens to be going through a very rough time with their GPU drivers</a>, with it being compared to AMD&rsquo;s previous problems with theirs.</p>
<p>I finally had the time recently to hop on VR to do some simracing, and since I hadn&rsquo;t been on my rig / headset in a while, I had to update everything, no big deal right? Well, think again. I had updated my GPU drivers a few weeks ago to one of the 572.x versions, and everything seemed fine, although I had some issues with weird artifacts on text and UI elements in certain games (mainly ready or not, some browser tabs even). So, as I updated my VR headset (a quest 2)&rsquo;s drivers, my displays flashed black, no big deal right? Maybe it&rsquo;s just doing something that it needs to do, right? I mean it hasn&rsquo;t done it before but it&rsquo;s been months since I updated. Well, no. After about 1-2 more times, it just stayed black. I immediately knew what the problem was, rebooted windows. Luckily, I was able to boot back without problem, and I immediately started by downloading a new version of DDU, and downloading the installer for the last &ldquo;stable&rdquo; nvidia driver 566.36.</p>
<p>I then booted into safe mode, DDU&rsquo;d+rebooted, disconnected my internet entirely before doing so (could&rsquo;ve done this before), and went into windows normally without drivers.</p>
<p>I then went to install driver version 566.36 via the installer I had downloaded for my graphics card, and well, I had accidentally downloaded the laptop drivers (I use an RTX 3050, I tried upgrading to an AMD Radeon RX 6750xt but I had some driver issues that I believe were conflicts with something else on my system, haven&rsquo;t bothered ever since I returned the card), so I went onto my laptop and got the right executable onto my pc via an OLD usb drive.</p>
<p>Installing went fine, and was actually much smoother than I expected, I did have to fix my monitor layout again (which is really annoying and take a good few minutes), but after that, I was back up and running, and everything that I did after was pretty much issue free. (aside from general steamvr/quest 2 issues which I&rsquo;ve had for ages)</p>
<p>I then finally booted up Ready or Not again today, and noticed that the artifcting was gone, alongside the text artifacting.</p>
<p>So, TLDR: Downgrade if you can, if you need to play a newer game such as Monster Hunter: Wilds or use a 50 series card, hopefully they&rsquo;re able to fix their problems soon. ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>
