        <p>I recently rebuilt my homelab setup, and with it, I decided to install <a href="https://crowdsec.net">CrowdSec</a> on my machines. For the uninformed, Crowdsec is a &ldquo;a behavioral solution that detects and blocks malicious IPs based on their behavior. It offers a Security Engine, a Console, a Remediation Component, and an AppSec Component for infrastructure and application security.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I signed up, and started with the free tier. I got my servers registered in their console as &ldquo;engines&rdquo;, and setup a remediation component. Specifically the firewall one, as I felt it would be fine for my usecase. The first thing that I noticed was that on the free tier, you are limited to just three <strong>free</strong> blocklists per account, without a <a href="https://www.crowdsec.net/pricing#saas-enterprise">paid subscription</a>. Not a huge deal, I can understand the majority of paid plans, althoughs some people may believe that $31 per &ldquo;security engine&rdquo; each month is a little absurd for most people, however you have to consider that this is for companies, not individuals. (this is the enterprise plan)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><img src="/images/my_experience_with_crowdsec/enterprise.png" alt="CrowdSec’s paid plan"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The three blocklist limit does suck, however you can always use a different application/firewall to block ips on lists from places such as <a href="https://www.blocklist.de/en/index.html">blocklist.de</a>, <a href="https://iplists.firehol.org/">FireHOL</a>, <a href="https://ipthreat.net/lists">or IpThreat</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to get into the ways to do that here, as this focuses on CrowdSec specifically.
Up to this point, I hadn&rsquo;t gotten any alerts, it was all quiet. This is more than likely a good? thing, however the real fun with CrowdSec came after I installed &amp; set it up on a VPS that I have.</p>
<p>As of now it&rsquo;s gotten 249 alerts, and the day that I put it on I swapped out <a href="https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban">Fail2Ban</a> with CrowdSec, as CrowdSec prevents SSH bruteforce. If I need it to monitor logs for my applications, then it will be coming back for sure, but I was only using it for SSH login attempts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m the only one, but I find it quite satisfying seeing everything that&rsquo;s been blocked. It&rsquo;s also a little spooky but fun at the same time, kinda like seeing this one bot that keeps attempting to connect to something I have behind cloudflare about 3-5 times a minute, approx. every three minutes. It keeps getting served a managed challenge, and had done about 450+ requests in under a day.</p>
<p>Back on topic, It also happens to do a lot more than just SSH Bruteforce, it also blocks requests attempting to abuse different vulnerabilities (not a huge issue if your servers are patched up, but it is nice to have)</p>
<h2 id="on-the-topic-of-ssh-bruteforcing-should-you-swap-this-with-fail2ban">On the topic of SSH Bruteforcing, should you swap this with Fail2Ban?<a href="#on-the-topic-of-ssh-bruteforcing-should-you-swap-this-with-fail2ban" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p><em>It depends.</em> If you use Fail2ban for more than just SSH, then keep it, you can add CrowdSec to stand in for the SSH protection that Fail2Ban comes with.</p>
<p><img src="/images/my_experience_with_crowdsec/list.png" alt="Silly Alerts"></p>
<p>This to me is quite nice, the VPS it&rsquo;s running on is quite small in terms of the resources it has, and as such it needs all the help it can get.</p>
<p>CrowdSec does use a noticeable bit of memory in the background if I can recall of the top of my head, but it&rsquo;s only signifigant if your machine/VPS doesn&rsquo;t have much RAM.</p>
<p>CrowdSec supports many other Remediation Components/Bouncers (basically what actually blocks traffic) besides just at the firewall level.</p>
<p><img src="/images/my_experience_with_crowdsec/components.png" alt="The List">
<em>(There are also many other bouncers available for other applications, services, and proxies)</em></p>
<p>The way each component works is different, on their documentation they say:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>nginx will check requester IP against the local API before granting or denying access.</li>
<li>firewall will add IPs to nftables/ipset set.</li>
<li>cloudflare will add IPs to the Cloudflare firewall.</li>
<li>blocklist will serve the blocklist to a appliance such as pfsense, fortinet, untangle via a http server.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>In Conclusion, what is my overall opinion on CrowdSec?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s decent. I do think that it is a decent service, especially so for enterprise customers (if all of their claims are true)</p>
