  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>Over the past couple of days I have begun converting my Roblox game over to a framework, now the history of frameworks on Roblox is interesting, the most well known one to my knowledge being <a href="https://github.com/Sleitnick/Knit">Knit</a>, which is no longer maintained/is now archived and has some <a href="https://scribe.rip/@sleitnick/knit-its-history-and-how-to-build-it-better-3100da97b36">issues outlined by it&rsquo;s creator</a>.</p>
<p>Knit was based on a SSA (Single Script Architecture) system, which basically means that one script (think of a script as a file of code), controls / manages a lot of other scripts (specifically <a href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ModuleScript">ModuleScripts</a>).</p>
<p>SSA isn’t bad, it can be a fine system to use for your game. There’s also MSA (Multi Script Architecture) as well, which I sorta had going excluding the part where everything was supposed to work together.</p>
<h1 id="so-why-did-i-move-over-to-a-framework-and-which-one">So, why did I move over to a framework? And which one?<a href="#so-why-did-i-move-over-to-a-framework-and-which-one" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h1>
<p>I moved because my game was built on 9+ month old spaghetti code. Now, not all of it was spaghettified, but a lot of it was, and the newer stuff, while cleaner, wasn’t integrated/connected very well due to nothing being organized properly or connected properly.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of my remote events folder, which contains events used to communicate from the server to the client and the client to the server. (my remote functions/bindable events weren&rsquo;t much better either)</p>
<p>Another thing to note, none of this is properly organized, likely 10-15 of these aren’t used or were used at one point but never properly removed for the fear of breaking something.</p>
<p>Do NOT be me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/converting-my-game-to-a-framework/remotes.png" alt="My Remote Event situation"></p></blockquote>
<p>(I have since changed the way I do a lot of these things, the reason why so many of these aren&rsquo;t used any more is due to testing code, among other things.)</p>
<p>I’m now using the <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/framework-quebec-typed-roblox-game-framework/3810890">Quebec</a> framework, which some might say to me: “Why quebec? Are you crazy? The devforum post for it isn’t even a month old yet!”</p>
<p>You’re right, it is new. However, for me, Quebec just works. I find it easy to understand, and it was really the only framework that I could find atleast on the devforum that seemed to be actively maintained and didn’t have some sort of flaw with it.</p>
<p>I did take a look at other frameworks such as <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/next-generation-roblox-framework-prvd-m-wrong/3136463">Prvd ‘M Wrong</a> and <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/artwork-the-framework-for-roblox/3775984">Artwork</a>.</p>
<p>Prvd ‘M Wrong seems to still be maintained (last commits/changes 3 weeks ago), alongside Artwork. However, after some testing, Quebec seemed to just work.
Now, it (to my knowledge) isn’t battle tested, same with the other two frameworks listed.</p>
<p>Quebec works off of the SSA system, but includes some really nice features such as Networking, Signals, and Channels.</p>
<h1 id="quebec">Quebec<a href="#quebec" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h1>
<p>Quebec has quite a few features, from Singletons (basically the services/things that you load), Lifecycle Events, Networking, Signals, Channels, and even Classes.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t go over everything here, but here&rsquo;s a quick (technical) rundown on some of the things listed above. If you have any questions, check out the <a href="https://baxoplenty.gitbook.io/quebec-docs/">documentation</a> for Quebec.</p>
<p>Networking is what you’d expect, it’s a better (depending on who you ask) way to handle networking on roblox, as it handles a lot of the remote events / remote function stuff for you.</p>
<p>Signals are also what you’d expect, however in this case they are basically a wrapper for a BindableEvent.</p>
<p>I won’t go into explaining Channels, because I haven’t delved into them too much just yet.</p>
<p>Qeubec also handles a lot more. However I’m getting off track again.</p>
<p>I’m still converting my code over to Quebec, however doing so has made a lot of my systems much more integrated, and my networking a lot easier to manage, as I have the opportunity to redo all of that stuff.</p>
<p>I should have another update on how Quebec is going later into the year, as I should have a lot more done by then, as currently my time has been spent converting over.</p>
<p>The nice thing about Quebec is it’s relatively simple (alteast to me), meaning that if I wanted to move to another SSA framework or my own, it wouldn’t take me too long to do so.</p>
<p>There are quite a few upcoming (and potentially upcoming) features for Quebec outlined in the <a href="https://github.com/BaxoPlenty/quebec/issues">Github Issues</a>, which I’m excited for as some of them would speed up some systems quite a lot.</p>
<p>So yeah, there’s my update on how that’s going!
Thank you to BaxoPlenty for making (and maintaining) Quebec, alongside everyone else in this post.</p>
<p>have a good one, and keep on creating</p>
