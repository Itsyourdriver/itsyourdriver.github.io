      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello howdy hola bonjour! It&amp;rsquo;s been a good few months since I last posted here, and also since I last streamed or posted a video on my channel, and I feel like giving an update on my almost complete radio silence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this time, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on getting a grasp on my mental health (this is a consistent battle on my end), all while fighting self-doubt and other things. I&amp;rsquo;ve been away from game development, not just because I needed a break, but because I was overwhelmed. I had put too many projects (3 TOTAL! NOT GOOD AT ALL) into something that I&amp;rsquo;d like to continue doing for the rest of my life, and as such, got overwhelmed quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re like me and deploy/upkeep static sites (this one included) semi-regularly using a generator such as hugo or another, you may have found that there are a few options for hosting said static sites. Whether that&amp;rsquo;s github (where this site is hosted), codeberg (which occasionally has uptime issues), cloudflare pages, statichost.eu, or even sourcehut pages. There are a lot of options. Now what if you could host your static pages, yourself? Well, that&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;re going to do today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I Downgraded My Nvidia Drivers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is going to be a short post from me, I just wanted to post about this because it was quite annoying.&#xA;As some of you may know, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXoUsdSAnA&#34;&gt;NVIDIA happens to be going through a very rough time with their GPU drivers&lt;/a&gt;, with it being compared to AMD&amp;rsquo;s previous problems with theirs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I finally had the time recently to hop on VR to do some simracing, and since I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been on my rig / headset in a while, I had to update everything, no big deal right? Well, think again. I had updated my GPU drivers a few weeks ago to one of the 572.x versions, and everything seemed fine, although I had some issues with weird artifacts on text and UI elements in certain games (mainly ready or not, some browser tabs even). So, as I updated my VR headset (a quest 2)&amp;rsquo;s drivers, my displays flashed black, no big deal right? Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just doing something that it needs to do, right? I mean it hasn&amp;rsquo;t done it before but it&amp;rsquo;s been months since I updated. Well, no. After about 1-2 more times, it just stayed black. I immediately knew what the problem was, rebooted windows. Luckily, I was able to boot back without problem, and I immediately started by downloading a new version of DDU, and downloading the installer for the last &amp;ldquo;stable&amp;rdquo; nvidia driver 566.36.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-i-intend-on-writing-a-follow-up-to-this-post-in-the-near-future-with-more-info-and-an-overview-of-my-current-stup-with-scripts-and-other-presets-for-you&#34;&gt;Update: I intend on writing a follow up to this post in the near future with more info and an overview of my current stup with scripts and other presets for you&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently rebuilt my homelab setup, and with it, I decided to install &lt;a href=&#34;https://crowdsec.net&#34;&gt;CrowdSec&lt;/a&gt; on my machines. For the uninformed, Crowdsec is &amp;ldquo;a behavioral solution that detects and blocks malicious IPs based on their behavior. It offers a Security Engine, a Console, a Remediation Component, and an AppSec Component for infrastructure and application security.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;It basically offers an advanced firewall (you&amp;rsquo;d want to keep UFW or whatever you&amp;rsquo;re using), detections for different vulnerabilities, SSH Brute force, http probing, etc, and frequently updated ip blocklists.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
